\section{Conclusion}

In this report, we have proposed a research idea and a plausible line of attack. We have also started preliminary work in implementing the prototype and experimental evaluation is under way. 
%We also discussed interesting research threads in the future work section

%Our approach combines 
%In future work,
%
%This work lays the foundation for some interesting extensions.
This report highlights the following contributions: 1) A line of direction to generate synthetic dataset for SyGuS benchmarks, 2) A "concolic" neural network architecture using logical embeddings and I/O embeddings and 3) A prototype tool SyGuS-Sketcher using existing techniques with experimentation plan.

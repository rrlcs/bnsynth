\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

The problem of Boolean Function Synthesis is a well known problem in computer science and has been in the limelight for past decade. Recently, synthesis of Boolean functions has found its applications in wide range of areas which includes reactive strategy synthesis \cite{Alur2005}, certified QBF-SAT solving \cite{Balabnav2012}, 
automated program synthesis (\cite{Solar2013, Gulwani2013}), circuit repair and debugging \cite{Jo} and the likes. This has motivated the community to develop practically efficient algorithms for synthesizing Boolean functions. Latest tool Manthan \cite{Manthan} claims to have beaten all the other state of the art tools by a margin of 76 benchmarks.
Manthan uses a Decision Tree based Learning approach to generate the skolem functions satisfying the given specification.

\noindent\textbf{Problem Statement:} Formally, given a Boolean formula F(X, Y) specifying a desired relation between inputs X and outputs Y, we wish to synthesize each output in Y as a function of inputs X such that F(X, Y) is satisfied, whenever possible.

Gated Continuous Logic Network or GCLN has been earlier used in learning Non Linear loop invariants \cite{gcln}. We leverage its power for our problem such that it generates the required skolem funciton.
% \noindent\textbf{Other works using sketches: } 
% Neural Edit Completion is a code completion technique that uses the context of the code environment as specification. A sketch in this context is the partial code that the user provides.

%Spec is context here!! Based on context you can predict a lot. Not keen on writing specs in FOL for sorting an array but ...(see the video) 45 mins approx
% Program synthesis using conflict-driven learning also talks about sketches in terms of partial programs.

\noindent\textbf{Contribution: } In this report, we discuss the details of how GCLN is employed to synthesize boolean formulae. We also discuss various approaches for solving Boolean Function Synthesis using Neural Network. The major topics are:
\begin{itemize}
\item  Sampling Strategy.
\item  A CNF based GCLN architecture.
\item  4 different problem formulations and their performance on toy examples
\item  Important meeting discussions
\end{itemize}

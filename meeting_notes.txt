Least constrained data

Data could don't cares. 

F(x, y) = x or y
i/p : x
o/p : y

x = 0, y = 1
x = 1, y = 0/1


1. try training for each output separately
2. try more sampling around data points which are not satisfied
3. look at data, may be there's something special there.
4. try with 1 pos unate and 1 neg unate.

Write down these cases.
